Sudoku Solver AR
Android app for solving sudoku puzzles using Open CV & Augmented Reality
------
Uses [OpenCv4Android](https://opencv.org/android/) for finding the location of the sudoku board on the image and [MLKIT Vision Text Recognition](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition/android) to retrieve the numbers.

NOTE: Works better with puzzles on paper and on smooth illuminated areas.
